KOI is a calm-but-cool micro-break app for teens.
It’s not therapy. It’s not motivational quotes. It’s a vibe — a water-themed, aesthetic reset space built for quick 30–180 second breaks.

Your task is to build a React Native app (Expo recommended but not required) that feels smooth, modern, and teen-friendly, focusing on visuals, sound, interaction, and personalization.

🎯 Purpose

KOI helps teens take fast mental resets that feel refreshing instead of preachy.
Everything should be:

Visual-first

Water-inspired

Minimalist

Zero cringe

Extremely simple to use

🌊 Core Experience

When a user taps “Take a Break,” they enter a full-screen scene of animated water.
No walls of text. No voiceovers.
Just a few tactile interactions and a short reset.

Break sessions should feel like:

Watching ripples spread

Guiding a koi fish

Listening to soft water sounds

Drifting for a minute

The feeling is quiet, clean, and aesthetic, not self-help.

✨ Main Features
1. Full-Screen Water Breaks

A water scene that reacts to touch.
Users should be able to:

Tap to create ripples

Drag or guide a koi fish around

Pop bubbles

Cause small waves or motions
Everything should feel smooth and visual.

2. Water Themes (Mainly Water-Based)

Several preset themes, such as:

Koi Pond (default)

Deep Sea

Rainy Window

Tide Pool

Glacier Lake

Zen River

Each theme changes the water color, atmosphere, sounds, and small visual effects.

3. Theme Customization

Let users customize their own themes:

Water color

Ripple intensity

Particle effects

Koi fish color

Ambient sound level

The customizer should feel playful, not technical.

4. Mood Slider

A simple “Foggy → Clear” slider that slightly adjusts the visuals based on mood.
No journaling. No data harvesting.
Just a quick emotional “check-in” for the user.

5. Micro Timer Options

Preset break lengths:

30 seconds

1 minute

3 minutes

The timer should be subtle and not dominate the screen.

6. Calm Soundscapes

Short looped ambience, such as:

Pond water

Deep underwater hum

Rain on glass

Gentle waves

Sound is optional and can be disabled.

7. Fidget Interactions

Small extras teens will love:

Guide a koi fish

Move lily pads

Tap little sparkles or bubbles

Create small waves with finger swipes

These should feel like a “fidget toy” but visual.

8. Privacy-First

Everything is local by default.
No mandatory accounts.
Any data (mood slider, streaks, saved themes) can stay on device.

🚀 “Above and Beyond” Ideas for Teens

Optional enhancements that fit the vibe:

Break Streaks: A soft streak counter with non-intense rewards.

Theme Sharing: Users can share custom themes with friends (locally or through a simple code).

Break Together: Sync a 60-second break with a friend using a simple join code.

Export Aesthetic Clips: Let users save or share a small looping animation of their water theme.

Hidden Interactions: Easter eggs, glowing particles, or special koi colors unlocked by use.

Low Motion Mode: Accessibility for motion sensitivity.

🎨 Style & Aesthetic Guidelines

Minimalist UI

Aesthetic water visuals

Gentle animations

Dark-mode first

Teen-friendly names and text (simple, casual, not preachy)

Examples of tone:

“Take a sec”

“Pick a vibe”

“Ready to drift?”

“Foggy → Clear”

🧭 App Structure (Conceptual Only)

Replit is free to create the layout, but suggested screens include:

Home (start break + quick controls)

Break Scene (water animation + interactions)

Themes (pick or customize)

Settings

Onboarding (very short, very simple)

💡 Development Notes (No Code Required)

The app should feel fluid, calm, and reactive to touch.

Water interactions should feel lightweight (not realistic physics, just aesthetic).

Teens prioritize vibe → keep UI clean + animations smooth.

Sound loops should be short and subtle.

🎁 Final Delivery Goals

A React Native app that:

Looks beautiful

Feels soothing

Has water-based micro-breaks

Has customization and interactivity

Is built with creative freedom

Feels modern and teen-centric
